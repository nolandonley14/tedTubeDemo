# TedTube Demo

This project is a demo for Algolia's search platform. It is built using the [React InstantSearch API](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch)

It is a current work in progress and this first incremental version is a single-page search application which allows you to search over 2,300 Ted Talk videos by name, speaker, description, event name, content tags, and date. The options on the left are various "tags" related to the videos and can help you begin or refine your search. Clicking on a video will bring up a modal with the title, speaker, event name, number of views, and the tags associated with the video.
